This is a simple library for rendering graphics, implementing game logic, etc.  It's backed by LWJGL for rendering graphics.

The aim of this project is to make creating games simple by abstracting away common logic.

The graphics portion is going to be geared towards 2D graphics, but should still support 3D graphics.
